Hi, Goik here, real name Samuel and I'm from Brazil.

I'm here to learn, practice and showcase my development skills =)
I have a 4 year bachelor degree in Information Systems, the blunt of my knowledge is Java with the basic of relational SQL databases, like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Currently I'm trying to learn the ropes of Web development and searching for a job as a junior software developer overseas or remote.

Curious? Message me.
